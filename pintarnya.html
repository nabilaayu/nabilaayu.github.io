        <div style="color: #2A83FD; font-weight: 500;">Designing job seeker skill quizzes</div><br>
        <img src="static/pintarnya/hero.png" class="center"><br><br>

        <h5 style="font-weight: 700;">Background</h5>
        <p>Pintarnya is a platform that connects blue-collar workers in Indonesia with employment and financial 
            opportunities. They were focused on ensuring job seekers had a positive experience, so they prioritized 
            initiatives that would keep them engaged and encourage them to apply for jobs.</p><br>
        <img src="static/pintarnya/brief.png" class="center"><br><br>

        <h5 style="font-weight: 700;">Project Outcome</h5>
        <p>This is what we got after the feature was released:</p>
        <img src="static/pintarnya/outcome.png" class="center"><br>
        <p>This shows that the feature is incredibly helpful in boosting users' confidence to apply for more jobs. 
            The following is the process I followed to achieve this ✨</p>
        <br><br>

        <h5 style="font-weight: 700;">Design Process</h5>
        <img src="static/pintarnya/process.png" class="center"><br><br>

        <h5 style="font-weight: 700;">Brainstorming Ideas</h5>
        <p>In the long run, the goal is to make it easier for employers to find valid, legit, and skilled job seekers. 
            This will help more job seekers get invited to interviews and solve The Problem. To support this, we 
            brainstormed a couple of ideas that could be initiated from the job seeker platform’s side:</p><br>
        <img src="static/pintarnya/Ideas.png" class="center"><br><br>
        <p><b>Overall, the skill quizzes is the best option.</b> Moreover, similar to the milestone badges concept, we could use 
            the sense of accomplishment after doing a quiz to drive confidence and encourage users to be more active 
            on the platform.</p>
        <br><br>

        <h5 style="font-weight: 700;">Benchmarking</h5>
        <p>I benchmarked other platforms implementing something similar to skill quizzes to discover UI/UX possibilities 
            and current industry standards.</p><br>
        <img src="static/pintarnya/benchmark.png" class="center"><br><br>
        <p>I was excited to see how other companies were approaching skill quizzes. I learned a lot about different ways 
            to present questions, provide feedback, and track progress. I also saw some common mistakes that I wanted to 
            avoid.</p>
        <p>With this information in mind, I was able to create a user flow that is both user-friendly and effective. I 
            also identified some opportunities to add features that would make the quiz even more engaging and helpful.</p><br>
        <img src="static/pintarnya/flow.jpg" class="center"><br><br>

        <h5 style="font-weight: 700;">Prototyping</h5>
        <p>I decided to skip wireframing and go straight to designing the high-fidelity prototype. This allowed me to get 
            a more accurate representation of the final product and save time in the long run. Check out some of the 
            screens below!</p><br>
        <img src="static/pintarnya/prototype.png" class="center"><br><br>

        <h5 style="font-weight: 700;">Usability Testing</h5>
        <p>I Google Meet with four Pintarnya users to get their feedback on the product. We also asked them about their 
            understanding of the value of doing skill quizzes for skill verification, and their motivation towards 
            raising their profile's value in the eye of employers. Here's what we learned:</p><br>

            </div>
            <div class="column2">
                <p>Users understand that it is important to highlight their skills to employers, but this is not always 
                    at the forefront of their minds.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="column2">
                <p>Users are motivated to improve their profiles, but they are not sure how to do this other than by 
                    improving the design of their CVs.</p>

        </div><br>

            </div>
            <div class="column2">
                <p>Users feel a sense of accomplishment after completing a quiz and would want to try as many as they can 
                    back to back.</p>
            </div>
        </div><br>

        <p><b>Overall, we found that users were positive about the product and its potential to help them improve their 
            skills and find better jobs.</b> However, a few potential improvements were identified in the copywriting 
            and UI.</p>
        <br><br>

        <h5 style="font-weight: 700;">Final Product</h5>
        <p>Here it is! Check out the final product, which has been adopted by an average of <b style="color: #33B630;">20%</b> of daily job seekers in 
            just one month, thanks to the feedback of our users.</p><br>
